# Amazon ElastiCache (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Cloud Research

### Amazon ElastiCache

- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases…
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with high performance, low latency
- Helps reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup,
  configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups

## Next Steps

- Amazon DynamoDB
